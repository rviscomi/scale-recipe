# scale-recipe

JS library that scales a list of ingredients of a recipe and converts up and down units accordingly.

## Demo

https://rviscomi.github.io/scale-recipe/

## Features

- A numeric stepper is injected in the serving size to adjust the yield.
- Units will change when too big or too small. For example, 1/4 cup becomes 3 tablespoons.
- Units will become plural/singular when grammatically necessary.
- Fractional units will be displayed in the simplest representation. For example, 1/2 instead of 2/4.
